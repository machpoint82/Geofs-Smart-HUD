Compatible with GeoFS **v3.9** and **v4.0**.

## Features

- **Ground Speed** — read directly from GeoFS's own `groundSpeedKnt` value
- **Indicated Airspeed (IAS)** and **True Airspeed (TAS)** — knots
- **Altitude** — feet (MSL)
- **Vertical Speed** — feet per minute
- **Heading** — degrees
- **Live flight-plan tracking** — reads your route straight out of GeoFS's own NAV panel, no manual entry:
  - Auto-advancing **next waypoint** with distance + ETA
  - **Destination** ETA (name + remaining route distance)
  - **Top of Climb** — time-based estimate off your current climb rate, toward the route's planned cruise altitude
  - **Top of Descent** — distance-based estimate using the standard 3nm-per-1000ft rule
- Draggable, position persists between sessions
- Toggle visibility anytime with **Shift + X**
- Dark glass panel styling with cyan/amber PFD-style readouts

## Installation

1. Install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extension if you don't already have it.
2. Open the [raw script file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/machpoint82/Geofs-Smart-HUD/main/geofs-smart-hud.user.js) — Tampermonkey should prompt you to install it directly.
3. Confirm the install, then head to [geo-fs.com](https://www.geo-fs.com/) and load into a flight.
4. The HUD appears top-right once the aircraft finishes loading.

Because this script includes `@updateURL`/`@downloadURL` pointing at this repo, Tampermonkey will check for and offer newer versions automatically. Note: this check runs on Tampermonkey's own schedule (roughly once a day), not the moment a new version is pushed — to grab an update immediately, open the Tampermonkey Dashboard and click the update icon next to the script, or use **Utilities → Check for userscript updates**.

### Enabling automatic updates in Tampermonkey

Tampermonkey checks scripts with an `@updateURL` on its own schedule (roughly every 6+ hours), but this has to be turned on:

1. Open the Tampermonkey Dashboard.
2. Go to **Settings** (top tab).
3. Under **General → Update**, set **Check for userscript updates** to **Automatically** (or the shortest interval offered).
4. Also make sure **"Ignore installed scripts’ own update policy"** is left unchecked, so this script's `@updateURL` is respected.

With this on, the HUD will update itself in the background — no need to reinstall manually after future releases.

## Usage

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Show/hide HUD | `Shift + X` |
| Move HUD | Drag the header bar |
| Close HUD | Click the ✕ in the header |
| Load a flight plan | Build a route in GeoFS's own NAV panel as usual — the HUD picks it up live |

## How it reads the game

GeoFS doesn't publish official documentation for most of its internals, so this script pulls values from a mix of GeoFS's own documented flight-plan format, properties recovered through GeoFS's public TypeScript typings (`@geps/geofs-types`), and field names confirmed in community userscripts:

| Readout | Source |
|---|---|
| IAS | `geofs.animation.values.kias` |
| TAS | `geofs.animation.values.ktas` (falls back to `.tas`) |
| Ground Speed | `geofs.animation.values.groundSpeedKnt` |
| Altitude | `geofs.animation.values.altitude` |
| Vertical Speed | `geofs.animation.values.verticalSpeed` (falls back to `.climbrate`) |
| Heading | `geofs.animation.values.heading` (falls back to `.heading360`) |
| Flight Plan | `geofs.nav.flightPlan` — live array of waypoint objects (`ident`, `lat`, `lon`, `alt`, `spd`, `heading`), matching [GeoFS's documented flight-plan JSON format](https://www.geo-fs.com/pages/documentation.php) |

If GeoFS changes these internal property names in a future update, the affected readout will show `--`. Check the browser console for `[Smart HUD]` log lines — the script logs its startup state to make debugging that easy.

## Known limitations

- **Top of Descent** assumes the destination sits near sea level, since GeoFS's flight-plan spec requires destination waypoints to carry `alt: 0` (no real field elevation is available to read). This means the estimate will trend a bit early for high-elevation airports.
- **Top of Climb** only appears while you're actively climbing toward a defined cruise altitude in your flight plan — it won't show anything if no altitude was set on any waypoint.

## Roadmap / ideas

- [ ] Wind-corrected GS/TAS delta readout
- [ ] OAT / autopilot altitude & heading bug display
- [ ] Smarter descent-point estimate using per-waypoint altitude constraints instead of a flat 3:1 rule
